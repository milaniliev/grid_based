GridAttachment
==============

MongoMapper-compatible GridFS file attachment, as simple as possible.

  class User
    include MongoMapper::Document
    include GridAttachment

    grid_attachment :photo
  end

  user.photo = params[:user][:photo] # from a multipart HTML form
  
  user.photo = File.open('sam.jpg') # from filesystem

  user.photo # => File object

Combine with http://github.com/skinandbones/rack-gridfs for serving files on the web.

  # in config/initializers/grid_attachment.rb or config/environment.rb
  GridAttachment.prefix = 'gridfs'

  # in a view
  <%= image_tag user.photo.grid_url %>

  # generates
  <img src="/gridfs/users/21e3d3280283e33/photo.jpg">
